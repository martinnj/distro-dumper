# distrowatch-dumper
Simple Docker container to automatically dump Linux/BSD Distro files from distrowatch.com's RSS
feed.



## Future Work

- Setup and dev instructions. :P
- Support regex instead of prefix, this would allow to filter for arch or desktop environments.
- Add support for custom UID/GUID in Docker image. Overlay?
